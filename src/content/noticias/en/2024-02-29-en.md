Ana Júlia Diniz Neves do Lago, an undergraduate student in International Relations at Unesp and a Scientific Initiation scholarship holder, was awarded a BEPE – Research Internship Abroad Scholarship (Process No. 2023/08867-5) at the University of Paris-Nanterre, France, funded by FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Pierre Sauvêtre.

Ana Júlia’s research project, titled *"Subjectivity and Oppression: A Gender Perspective on Neoliberalism"*, was carried out between November 1, 2023, and February 29, 2024. During this period, she participated in the Sophiapol research laboratory, where she deepened her understanding of neoliberalism—particularly its concepts of subjectivity and oppression, and how these dynamics especially affect women.

This research was connected to a broader project developed in Brazil ([Process No. 2022/08490-6](https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/bolsas/211973)) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hélio Alexandre da Silva. The opportunity to conduct part of her research at a prestigious international institution such as the University of Paris-Nanterre provided Ana Júlia with a highly enriching experience, broadening her academic perspectives and contributing significantly to her academic development.
