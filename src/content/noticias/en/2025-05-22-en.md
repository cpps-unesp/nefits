It is with great joy that NéFiTs announces the awarding of the BEPE/FAPESP scholarship to our member *Eduarda Pereira Pires Barboza*, who is currently undertaking a research internship at the University of Sussex, in England, under the supervision of Professor Gurminder K. Bhambra. 

With the project entitled “Beyond Piketty: A Different Perspective on Social Inequality”, the research will be carried out from April 27 to July 26, 2025. Eduarda’s achievement strengthens our group’s academic production and reaffirms our commitment to critical reflection on social inequalities in dialogue with international references. Congratulations, Eduarda!
