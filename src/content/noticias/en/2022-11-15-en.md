Law student at FCHS, Matheus de Vilhena Moraes, was awarded the BEPE Scholarship – Research Internship Abroad – to develop part of his research originally conducted in Brazil with funding from FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hélio Alexandre da Silva.

From August to November 2022, Matheus participated in the Global Justice Program at Yale University, located in New Haven, United States. Under the guidance of Prof. Thomas Pogge, he developed his project entitled “Criterion of Universal Justice, Negative Duty and Positive Duty of Justice: a theoretical study of the institutional reform concepts proposed by Thomas Pogge.”

This opportunity allowed Matheus to deepen his research in a world-renowned academic environment, significantly contributing to his academic and professional development. The international experience also provided him with a valuable exchange of knowledge and practices with other researchers in the field of global justice.
