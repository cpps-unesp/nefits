From March 3 to July 18, Eduarda Pereira Pires Barboza, an International Relations student, took part in a visit to the Universidad de Playa Ancha (UPLA) in Chile. Her research focuses on social inequality, and this exchange was crucial in broadening her understanding of the topic.

During her stay, Eduarda encountered a different approach to inequality. By participating in conferences and academic events, and engaging in conversations with peers and professors, she observed that the distinction between what is public and what is state-run is often emphasizedâ€”an insight that enriched her perspective on the nuances of inequality in different sociopolitical contexts.
