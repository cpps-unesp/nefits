Sofia Grandini, a member of our research group, has been awarded a BEPE/FAPESP scholarship to carry out a research internship at Seoul National University, in South Korea, under the supervision of Professor Hyunji Kwon. The project, entitled Social Theory as Class Theory: An Analysis of Brazilian “Batalhadores” and South Korean “Non-Standard Workers”, will be conducted between April and August 2025 and aims to investigate the forms of precarization and social suffering associated with new configurations of work in Brazilian and South Korean societies. 

The research is part of the thematic project “The Batalhadores as an Object of Social Philosophy: Characterization and Forms of Suffering” and represents a significant step forward in the group’s reflections on poverty, labor, and social theory. Congratulations, Sofia, on this important achievement!
